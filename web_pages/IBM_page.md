## Step 5: Manage your invoices and payment methods

Before you start working with resources in your account, familiarize yourself with where you can manage your payment method and access your invoices.

### Managing your payment method

* To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Payments.
* To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to IBM Billing.

### Accessing your invoices

* To access an invoice for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Invoices.
* To access an invoice for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Invoices. Then, click IBM Invoices.

## Step 6: Set preferences for receiving notifications

1. Complete the following steps to set your preferences for receiving various types of notifications:
	* To receive notifications about unplanned events, planned maintenance, announcements, go to the Avatar icon Avatar icon Profile and settings > Notifications.
	* Platform notifications are associated with the IBM Cloud platform and don't apply to events related to IBM Cloud services. By default, all platform notifications are turned off.

Infrastructure notifications apply only to the account in which the preferences are set. By default, all infrastructure notifications are turned on.
To receive spending notifications, go to Manage > Billing and usage > Spending notifications. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify.

## Step 7: Create your resource groups

Resource groups provide a way for you to easily manage access to multiple resources and to view billing usage for a set of resources. With your Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create more resource groups in addition to the default resource group that's included when you first created your Lite account.

1. Go to Manage > Account > Account resources > Resource groups.
Click Create.
1. Enter a name for your resource group, and click Add.
